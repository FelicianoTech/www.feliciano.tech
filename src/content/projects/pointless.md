Pointless is a CircleCI Chrome Extension that enhances your browsing experience while developing. For example, while viewing a project page on GitHub, you can see its build status and follow/unfollow that project on CircleCI right from the GitHub page.

More features, such as searching CircleCI Docs, will be coming soon. Visit our GitHub page for the feature roadmap, support, and to contribute.
