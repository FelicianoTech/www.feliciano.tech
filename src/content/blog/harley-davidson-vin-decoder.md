Now that I own a Harley Davidson Sportster I've been getting into motorcycles from a mechanical perspective.
I'm still a software engineer though so when I saw that many Harley VIN decoders on the Internet either were missing data for newer bikes (like mine) or simply didn't work anymore, I decided to make one myself.

I created my own Harley-Davison VIN Decoder in JavaScript and built it right into this very website.
You can take a look and if you own a Harley, decode your own VIN right [here](/projects/hd-vin-decoder/).

For those who don't know what a VIN decoder is, every street vehicle (a car, truck, or motorcycle) has a VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) which is assigned by the manufacturer.
This VIN contains information about the manufacturer, model, engine, and more.
My Harley VIN decoder lets you see all of that information for your bike or even one you're interested in buying.
