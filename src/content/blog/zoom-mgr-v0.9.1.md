Zoom Manager (`zoom-mgr`) is a tool to easily install and update the Zoom video conferencing software on the Ubuntu Linux distribution.
With the v0.9.1 release, I've added support for the in-development Ubuntu Hirsute release cycle.
More exciting, upon request [on GitHub](https://github.com/felicianotech/zoom-mgr/issues/23), I've now added official support for Linux Mint as well.
Support starts from the v19 release of Linux Mint up to current.
Testing was done specifically with the Cinnamon desktop environment.

Instructions to download and use Zoom Manager is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/felicianotech/zoom-mgr>
