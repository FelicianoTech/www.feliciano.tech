Congratulations to everyone who worked on and shipped Ubuntu 18.04 "Bionic Beaver".

As per usual, I just want to remind everyone that you can download the Ubuntu 18.04 ISOs via torrent. This allows you to reduce the strain on Canonical’s (and their mirror) servers while possibly being a faster download as well.

Here are the torrents for both the desktop and server release:

- [Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop (64-bit)][1] 
- [Ubuntu 18.04 Server (64-bit)][2]
  
Don’t forget to seed! I will be.
