As any other New York Mets fan would, I've been watching the 2020 "season" on SNY everyday.
I've noticed a new graphic that SNY has been using that I really like.
It takes the standard Mets logo but removes the bridge and Mets script, and instead places the hat insignia on it.
I really like it so I attempted to replicate it and turn it into a 4k desktop wallpaper.

You'll find the preview in this post but you can download the full resolution 4K/16:9 version (for normal screens) and a nearly-4K/16:10 version (for Macbook-like screens) from the links below.
