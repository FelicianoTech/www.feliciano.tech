In continuing with my series of CircleCI desktop wallpapers, here's another one.
People seemed to like the Halloween wallpaper so I decided to make another season themed one, "Northern Winter".

You'll find the preview in this post but you can download the full resolution 4K/16:9 version (for normal screens) and a nearly-4K/16:10 version (for Macbook-like screens) from the links below.
