I'm making a simple game, written with Flutter/Dart, and I will publish it on Google Play.

## Motivation

Honestly, a few things are motivating me here.

First and foremost is my daughter and the lack of "decent" games for her.
She is five years old and practically every game she plays on Android is full of ads, ads, ads.
I don't consider ads to be the end of the world but the problem here is, the ads aren't good.
These ads are horrible, try to trick you, and sometimes make finding the 'x' that you click to skip them very difficult to find.
Not cool.

Secondly, I want to make something with Flutter.
That is to say, not just a partially complete side project.
I want to make something from beginning to end, with it released on Google Play for others to use.
That would be nice.


## Why now

I'm in a rut.
If you follow my journey over on [Struggle SaaS](https://strugglesaas.com/) you'll know that I am struggling to get Melitix going.
As I figure out how to move forward with that project or if I even should, I want a fun distraction.
Something that I can start and finish in a small, finite amount of time.
Not something that is never really done like SaaS.

I also am planning on using Flutter as the means to get my SaaS projects to be cross-platform.
Especially for mobile.
This little project will be my way to dive in and brush up my skills before then.


## What am I making?

I am not a game developer.
I can't do fancy graphics.
I am capable of simple things.
Back in 2007 I made a software version of the old game Simon for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) called Simon Remix.
I wrote about this a bit on [Struggle SaaS](https://strugglesaas.com/blog/week-5--reminiscing-about-my-first-public-software/).

Several years later I then ported the game over to BlackBerry.
If you had a BlackBerry Curve or BlackBerry Pearl and access to BlackBerry World, their app store, you could have bought the game for $5.
This was the first time I've ever made money from software.

I've realized that each time I've made this game, it was the first time that I wrote software for that device or platform.
It seemed very fitting then that my first Flutter and Android app shall be the latest rendition of this game, Simon Remix.

This game will be made with Android in mind.
Since it's going to be made with Flutter, I'll be able to distribute it to other platforms at some point in the future.
It will also be open-source and up on GitHub.
Btw, since I'm starting late on Saturday, the "weekend" for this build will be Saturday \- Monday. :wink:
