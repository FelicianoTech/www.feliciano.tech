Little less than a week ago, the <a title="Check out the plugin on WordPress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-about-author/" target="_blank">Custom About Author plugin</a> for WordPress was updated to v1.4.2. Why I care? This is the first open-source project, however small, that I was able to contribute code and it get published.

At <a title="Visit SonyRumors.net" href="http://sonyrumors.net" target="_blank">SonyRumors.net</a>, there was a need to have the Custom About Author (CAA) box at the top of a post rather than the bottom. Taking a look at the <a title="Official Page" href="http://littlehandytips.com/plugins/custom-about-author/" target="_blank">developer&#8217;s site</a>, I&#8217;ve noticed others have had similar request, and the only solution was to hack the code, or attempt at using the shortcode feature. That is too advanced for some users so yours truly wrote a patch to the plugin, adding an option to place the CAA box at the top of post. As seen by the <a title="Changelog" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-about-author/changelog/" target="_blank">changelog</a>, this new feature landed in v1.4.2 on May 5th, 2012.

Once again, this is only a small change to a plugin, however it&#8217;s hopefully a stepping stone for me to one day be able to contribute to great projects. Thanks again to Edwin Kwan, the author of the plugin for allowing me to contribute. For WordPress users, if you haven&#8217;t yet, check out the Custom About Authors plugin (links below). It&#8217;s prettyÂ useful.
