Congratulations to everyone who worked on and shipped Ubuntu 19.10 "Eoan Ermine".

As per usual, I just want to remind everyone that you can download the Ubuntu 19.10 ISOs via torrent.
This allows you to reduce the strain on Canonical’s (and their mirror) servers while possibly being a faster download as well.

Here are the torrents for both the desktop and server release:

- [Ubuntu 19.10 Desktop (64-bit)][1] 
- [Ubuntu 19.10 Server (64-bit)][2]
  
Don’t forget to seed! I will be.
