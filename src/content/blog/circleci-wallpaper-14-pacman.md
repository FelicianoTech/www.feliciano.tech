In continuing with my series of CircleCI desktop wallpapers (after over a year!), here's another one.

Since my last one, CircleCI has raised a series F round of funding and we hit 10 years old.
I myself am getting closer to my 6-year mark at the company and felt very reflective.
Like Pac-Man, CircleCI started in a very different time.
A pretty impressive journey but we're just getting started.

You'll find the preview in this post but you can download the full resolution 4K/16:9 version (for normal screens) and a 4K/16:10 version (for Macbook-like screens) from the links below.
