Looking into GNOME extension development I quickly became aware that they are dependant on GNOME Shell versions.
While I can easily determine which version of GNOME Shell one of my computers is running, it becomes more work when I had to consider multiple Ubuntu versions as well as what others might be using.

Since I couldn't find this information in one place, I decided to put together a table of some Linux distros, their recent releases, and which GNOME Shell version they are using.
Hopefully someone else may find this helpful as well.

Distro | Version | GNOME Shell
--- | --- | ---
Debian | 10 "Buster" | v3.30
Debian | 11 "Bullseye" | v3.38
Debian | 12 "Bookworm" | v43
Fedora Workstation | 36 | v42
Fedora Workstation | 37 | v43
Fedora Workstation | 38 | v44
Ubuntu | 20.04 "Focal" | v3.36
Ubuntu | 22.04 "Jammy" | v42
Ubuntu | 23.04 "Lunar" | v44
