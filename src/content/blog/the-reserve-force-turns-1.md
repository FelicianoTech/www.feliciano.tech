Hey everyone!
It's been a little while since I've blogged.
Recently I got an email from Google Analytics telling me that The Reserve Force (TRF) reached its first little milestone.
It also reminded me that just a couple of months ago TRF hit its first birthday!

TRF is an open source website I started with one of my shipmates as a way to provide free information and resources for U.S. Navy reservists and eventually other branches.
At the end of January TRF hit its first birthday, reaching an age many of my projects never reach.
You can read our write up about that milestone [here](https://www.thereserveforce.com/blog/the-reserve-force-turns-1/).

Google Analytics sent me an email telling me that TRF reached a milestone of 2,000 clicks within 4 weeks!

In the grand scheme of things 2K clicks in 4 weeks isn't a lot but it's a decent milestone to get started with.
It's validation that something I built is useful for someone out there.
At the end of the day, that's why I build things.
