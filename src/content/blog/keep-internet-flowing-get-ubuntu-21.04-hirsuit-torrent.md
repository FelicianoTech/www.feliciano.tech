Congratulations to everyone who worked on and shipped Ubuntu 21.04 "Hirsuit Hippo".

A special thanks to Martin Wimpress who recently [left Canonical](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/02/martin-wimpress-ubuntu-desktop-lead-leaving-canonical) and Alan Pope who [will be](https://twitter.com/popey/status/1380139900108963848) at the end of this month.
Both men put enormous amounts of time into the community from inside and out of Canonical.
This is in addition to the superb Ubuntu Podcast they put out every week.
Thank you gentlemen for your service.

As per usual, I just want to remind everyone that you can download the Ubuntu 21.04 ISOs via torrent.
This allows you to reduce the strain on Canonical’s (and their mirror) servers while possibly being a faster download as well.

Here are the torrents for both the desktop and server release:

- [Ubuntu 21.04 Desktop (64-bit)][1] 
- [Ubuntu 21.04 Server (64-bit)][2]
  
Don’t forget to seed!
