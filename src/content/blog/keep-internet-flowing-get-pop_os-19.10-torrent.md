As far as I know, System76 doesn't provide torrents for their ISO downloads and that's a shame.
I decided to make some for their two releases, the standard x86_64 ISO as well as the Nvidia ISO.
Basically, the Nvidia version is the same as the first one but the Nvidia graphic drivers are preloaded.

The SHA256 sum for the regular ISO is: `b6d54360f0655d4f7cbd80211b3bfb476066fa9d86d6fcfa864953b7fcb5ec69`  
The SHA256 sum for the Nvidia ISO is: `609bab3f920ed961730d677740bba2c90a1ced46ba75a1a7d0dfd076c6f4b4d3`

You can verify these for yourself on their [download page](https://system76.com/pop).

Congratulations to the System76 Team!

Here are the torrents for both the Intel/AMD 64-bit and Nvidia releases:

- [Pop!_OS 19.10 Intel/AMD (64-bit)][1] 
- [Pop!_OS 19.10 Nvidia (64-bit)][2]
  
Donâ€™t forget to seed! I will be.
