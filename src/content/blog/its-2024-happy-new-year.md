I'm a bit late but Happy New Year Internet! :tada:

I'm looking forward to a great year.
Unlike some, I'm still excited about a fresh year starting and what opportunities lie ahead.
One thing I plan to change however, is how I go about sharing my dreams and goals.
Instead of sharing them here and now, I am going to share more things as they happen.
Changes in life, new projects, cancelled projects, etc.

Stay tuned. (Two great ways to do so is via my [newsletter](/newsletter) or [Mastodon](https://nanobyte.cafe/@FelicianoTech)).
