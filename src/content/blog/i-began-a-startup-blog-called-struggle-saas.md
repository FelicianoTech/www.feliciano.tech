Dear reader, thank you.
Reading this means you're one of the many who visit my website/tech blog each month.
This blog gets more traffic than any other website or project I have.
With that note, I wanted to share that I started a new blog last month.

In March, I decided to pursue an idea in the in-person events space called Melitix.
Often, when I start a project, I lose interest after a while and move on to something else.
To help avoid that happening with Melitix, I decided to publicly journal my experience starting the company.
Thus, [Struggle SaaS](https://strugglesaas.com/) was born.

You can visit the blog via the link above or read an excerpt from the first Struggle SaaS post below:

:wave: Welcome to *Struggle SaaS*, my new blog documenting the journey of building Melitix Events and the struggle leading up to it.

## Why Document Building Melitix

I’m building a “nights & weekends” startup with a friend I’ve known since middle school.
Right in that previous sentence, there are a few points of potential hardship ahead:

1. **nights & weekends**—Building something just on your nights and weekends is hard. I know. I’ve tried many times before and have failed again and again. My financial situation means I don’t have a choice at the moment to do this full-time.
1. **with a friend**—This can also be tricky. Doing business with friends or family can be a double-edged sword. If things go wrong, there’s a risk of ruining important relationships. On the upside, many, such as [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/faq#can-a-single-person-apply-for-funding) and [Rob Walling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDaa5VNfhD0), suggest that more than one founder can be better for a business.

I know this will be hard, and I might fail again.
This time, however, I want to document it.
I will learn more from the experience, and you, dear reader, can learn something from my experiences as well.
There's something about working in public that I think will motivate me.
