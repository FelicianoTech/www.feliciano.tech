This is the U.S. Prisoner of War (POW)/Missing in Action flag. As explained on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW/MIA_flag" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:

> The POW/MIA flag is an American flag designed as a symbol of citizen concern about United States military personnel taken as prisoners of war (POWs) or listed as missing in action (MIA).

In the Navy, whenever you visit a galley (where we eat) you&#8217;ll always see a beautifully set table, plates and all, left completely untouched. A small flag and a note tells that missing service member we&#8217;re still thinking of you. The Navy <a href="http://navylive.dodlive.mil/2015/09/17/by-the-numbers-the-navys-missing-in-action/" target="_blank">shared some numbers today</a> on POWs/MIAs.

If you&#8217;re wondering why you&#8217;ve been seeing this today, today is <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/pow-mia-recognition-day" target="_blank">National POW/MIA Recognition Day</a>. If you think some of your friends may not know what this flag is, please share.

So if you support the U.S. military branch flags, please don&#8217;t forget this one.
