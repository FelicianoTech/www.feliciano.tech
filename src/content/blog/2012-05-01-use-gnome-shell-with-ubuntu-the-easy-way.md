For those Unity haters, alternative desktop options are sparse on a standard install of Ubuntu. If you don&#8217;t want Unity, you may choose Unity 2D. Yeah, not exactly an alternative is it.

The Ubuntu repositories provide some options. We can install GNOME Classic or GNOME Shell. For some though, installing Ubuntu, then having to install GNOME Shell afterward is just too tedious. For those people, there&#8217;s Ubuntu GNOME Shell Remix. An unofficial remix of Ubuntu, with GNOME Shell baked right in.

With the release of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (which you can download [fast here][2]), comes the fresh release of Ubuntu 12.04 GNOME Shell Remix.

Download it, Try it out:

64-bit ISO (torrent) - link no longer exists

32-bit ISO (torrent) - link no longer exists

or download via their site: <http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/download/>.
