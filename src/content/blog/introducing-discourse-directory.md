I made a new website called Discourse.Directory and you can check it out [here](https://Discourse.Directory).

I'm a **very** big fan of the open-source forum software called [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). I'm a big proponent of community and for online communities, forums are key. Forums have sucked for a long, long time. Finally, [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/) and friends came along and brought us something better.

Discourse is great because it's forum software that:

1. is open-source
1. supports Markdown for writing post
1. has a "trust" system that works fairly well
1. doesn't feel the need to support outdated browsers
1. and much, much more

## Why Create Discourse Directory

I tend to hang around software projects longer when they use a Discourse forum. Hugo, Nextcloud, Snapcraft, and my employer CircleCI all utilize Discourse. I came to like it so much I figured it would be cool to see who else uses Discourse. Finding a single place to see what Discourse forums exists was difficult. Basically, [a single post](https://meta.discourse.org/t/please-visit-our-discourse-forum-directory/3102) on the Meta site itself was all I could find.

Since I play with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) daily at this point, I figured I'd try making my own directory site powered by Hugo. Here we are. It's still a work-in-progress so if you have any ideas or would like to contribute, you can do so on [GitHub](https://github.com/felicianotech/discourse.directory).
