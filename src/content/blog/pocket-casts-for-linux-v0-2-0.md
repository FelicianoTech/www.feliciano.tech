Towards the end of 2018 I took the Pocket Casts webapp and packaged it to release the [Pocket Casts Desktop for Linux][orig-post].
Since then, lots of people have been asking for one thing, media key support.

With Pocket Casts Desktop for Linux v0.2.0, this has been delivered.
If you have the snap installed, you'll have this update shortly.
The .deb can be found in the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/felicianotech/pocket-casts-desktop-app/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

Seeing this for the first time?
See my [original post][orig-post] for screenshots and install instructions.
