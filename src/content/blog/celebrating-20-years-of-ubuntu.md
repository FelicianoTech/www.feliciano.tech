Today is a special day for those of us who've used the little orange Linux distribution known as Ubuntu.
Twenty years ago today Ubuntu 4.10 "Warty Warthog" was released.
Since then, we've had 40 additional adjective and animal alliterative releases full of adventure, amusement, and sometimes absurdity.
Sure, there's been some ups and downs, but that's what makes roller coasters fun, right? :laughing:

## Impact

I first tried Ubuntu at the 9.04 "Jaunty Jackalope" release, and it introduced me to an entirely new world.
I was hungry to learn more about computers, software, and the Internet and to build things from what I had learned.
Since I couldn't afford tools such as Macromedia Fireworks and Dreamweaver, my time on Windows was spent in a delicate balance between pirating software and avoiding malware.

Ubuntu made software accessible to me.
In fact, it wasn't just software.
Ubuntu introduced me to a community of people who were nerdy like me.
It introduced me to people much smarter than me from whom I could watch and learn.
That brings me to the feature graphic I made above.


## Goodies

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Ubuntu, I decided to make this little graphic to capture the history of Ubuntu, from my perspective.
It's filled with projects and people that have influenced Ubuntu and people like me in the community.
Please don't be offended if I didn't include your project or you personally.
I had limited space and time; and frankly, the Ubuntu community is big.
I don't know everyone.

If you'd like to use the image as a desktop wallpaper, or maybe you just want to get a closer look at all the "tiles", I [uploaded a 4K version to Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/felicianotech/54078534077/in/dateposted-public/).
If you'd like to see Ubuntu-related art from an actual artist, I highly recommend checking out Sylvia Ritter's [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/sylvia_ritter).
Her work is spectacular, emotion-inducing and yes, she's in one of my tiles. Can you find her?


## Continuing the celebration

Creating this graphic and writing this post made me a bit sentimental.
Ubuntu feels different nowadays.
I don't know what the future holds, but it won't change the fantastic memories from the past.
It's worth celebrating everything that a worldwide community has built.
Over the next few days I'll turn this into an "Ubuntu 20th" mini-series on my blog.
Stay tuned for more orange content. :slightly_smiling_face:
