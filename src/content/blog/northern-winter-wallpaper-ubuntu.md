I decided to make an Ubuntu version of the [CircleCI winter wallpaper](/blog/circleci-wallpaper-13-northern-winter/) I published earlier today.
You'll find the preview in this post but you can download the full resolution 4K/16:9 version (for normal screens) and a nearly-4K/16:10 version (for Macbook-like screens) from the links below.
