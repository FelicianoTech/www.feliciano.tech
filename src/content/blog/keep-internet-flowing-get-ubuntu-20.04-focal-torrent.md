Congratulations to everyone who worked on and shipped Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa".

As per usual, I just want to remind everyone that you can download the Ubuntu 20.04 ISOs via torrent.
This allows you to reduce the strain on Canonical’s (and their mirror) servers while possibly being a faster download as well.

Here are the torrents for both the desktop and server release:

- [Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop (64-bit)][1] 
- [Ubuntu 20.04 Server (64-bit)][2]
  
Don’t forget to seed! I will be.
