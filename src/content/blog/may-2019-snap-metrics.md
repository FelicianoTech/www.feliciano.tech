I maintain a few Snap packages (installable Linux software packages) and I've been very interested in the metrics that [Snapcraft][snapcraft] (the Snap Store) provides.
It's a (minor) indicator of how large the snap user base is (or at least growth) as well as how useful a snap may or may not be.
In October I started this [Linux Snap Package Metrics](/blog/october-2018-snap-metrics/) series and I'll be updating every month with the numbers until someone tells me otherwise :smile:.

Here's the metrics for snaps I maintain for the past month:

<!--more-->

| Snap | # Active Devices |
| --- | --- |
| [circleci](https://Snapcraft.io/circleci) | 876 |
| [hub](https://Snapcraft.io/hub) | 1,271 |
| [linode-cli](https://Snapcraft.io/linode-cli) | 51 |
| [pocket-casts](https://Snapcraft.io/pocket-casts) | 515 |
| [scc](https://Snapcraft.io/scc) | 50 |
| [zsync](https://Snapcraft.io/zsync) | 137 |

There's a couple items of note here.

1. I haven't done this post in a few months so I've excluded the % change column this time around.
1. I've also dropped the distro column. Didn't seem useful.
