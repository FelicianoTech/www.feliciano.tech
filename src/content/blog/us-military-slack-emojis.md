Yesterday was the official Veteran's Day Holiday in the United States and today is Veteran's Day (Observed).
I wanted to give a shout out to my fellow veteran colleagues at CircleCI in our Slack Team and realized there wasn't any custom Slack emojis for the U.S. branches of military.
So I created some.

Here's each icon, my suggested Slack name and alias, with the download link at the bottom:

- name: `:us-navy:`
- alias: `:usn:`

- name: `:us-marine-corps:`
- alias: `:usmc:`

- name: `:us-army:`
- alias: `:usa:`

![](/assets/img/article/army-icon.png)

- name: `:us-air-force:`
- alias: `:usaf:`

You can download each of the four icons together in a zipfle:
