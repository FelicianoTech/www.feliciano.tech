Yesterday was the official Veteran's Day Holiday in the United States and today is Veteran's Day (Observed).
I wanted to give a shout out to my fellow veteran colleagues at CircleCI in our Slack Team and realized there wasn't any custom Slack emojis for the U.S. branches of military.
So I created some.

I'm no longer in the Navy but I love my branch and am fortunate for the experienes and knowledge I've gained with them.

I created a Slack emoji for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, and U.S. Air Force.
I've packaged all four icons together in a zipfle:

Here's a summary of each icon, my suggested Slack name and alias:

- name: `:us-navy:`
- alias: `:usn:`
