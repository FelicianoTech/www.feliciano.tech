This post is fairly late but I wanted to try something new. A gentleman named RaphaÃ«l Hertzog writes a blog post every month on his FOSS contributions for that month. For example, here's [his post for January 2017][1]. This is an awesome thing to do and I would like to get started with my own January 2017, which is only a single item. :disappointed:
