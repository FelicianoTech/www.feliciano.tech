I maintain a several [Snap packages](/blog/what-are-linux-snap-packages-why-use-them/) (installable Linux software packages) and I've been very interested in the metrics that [Snapcraft][snapcraft] (the Snap Store) provides.
It's a (minor) indicator of how large the snap user base is (or at least growth) as well as how useful a snap may or may not be.
Plus, it's a nice feeling to see the usage of something I've made go up.
In October of 2018 I started this [Linux Snap Package Metrics](/blog/october-2018-snap-metrics/) series and I'm trying to report back every few months with the numbers.

Here's the metrics for snaps I maintain for the past month:
