I love open source documentation and if you're reading this, maybe you do too.
I have a personal mantra of "Inspire, Educate, Motivate".
Documentation allows us to **educate** others to a near infinite scale.

You know, I partially owe my career to the free and accessible Linux server documentation that is available on the [Linode Docs](https://www.linode.com/docs/) website.
I'm a die-hard Ubuntu user but I can't tell you the countless times the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) has helped me out of tight spots.

Docs are invaluable.

I want to **motivate** more people to contribute and learn from one another on how we can make better contributions and better doc websites.
[DocsThursday](https://DocsThursday.com) is a party, campaign, workshop, or whatever you want to call it to create and contribute to open source documentation on the 3rd Thursday of every month.

## Why DocsThursday?

There's nothing special about Thursdays.
I could have does a Docs Wednesday or Friday but it wasn't as catchy and we all know Tuesdays are for tacos.
So DocsThursday it is.

DocsThursday is inspired by DigitalOcean's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/), and most importantly, Write the Docs's [Writing Day](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/writing-day/).
I'm trying to take the energy and productivity of Writing Day and do it more frequently at meetups local to you, with your co-workers within your company, and as an online hackathon.

Let's take 30 minutes, an hour or more, once a month in order to give some love to open source documentation.

Interested? Check out the website, [DocsThursday.com](https://DocsThursday.com).


## Would you like to help out?

DocsThursday is brand new and I'm still figuring out what to do with it.
The [website is open source](https://github.com/felicianotech/docsthursday.com) and built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Feel free to open PRs to improve the website or open Issues to ask questions or start discussions.
You can also start discussions/ask questions here in the comments or [message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FelicianoTech).

If you've had these feelings or similar ideas, speak up!
Let's do this together. :smile:

**P.S.** The first DocsThursday is February 21st.
I run the Write the Docs NYC meetup and we're hosting an event in New York for DocsThursday.
If you're around, [check it out](https://www.meetup.com/WriteTheDocsNYC/events/258747106/).
If you're not, start one in your area on the 21st and I'll list it on the DocsThursday website for people to find.
