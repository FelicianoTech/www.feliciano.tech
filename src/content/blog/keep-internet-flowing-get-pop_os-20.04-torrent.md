As I did [for the 19.10 release](https://www.feliciano.tech/blog/keep-internet-flowing-get-pop_os-19.10-torrent/), I created torrents for the latest Pop!_OS release, 20.04.
There's one for the standard x86_64 ISO as well as the Nvidia ISO.
Basically, the Nvidia version is the same as the first one but the Nvidia graphic drivers are preloaded.

The SHA256 sum for the regular ISO is: `5478241142930dbd95143773d53be079087024d3112614a901edc2829040f996`  
The SHA256 sum for the Nvidia ISO is: `a2e0ebc25999036dcd0b89fd21d49069438a529fd8c46ffc31053258b447f9e8`

You can verify these for yourself on their [download page](https://system76.com/pop).

Congratulations to the System76 Team!

Here are the torrents for both the Intel/AMD 64-bit and Nvidia releases:

- [Pop!_OS 20.04 Intel/AMD (64-bit)][1] 
- [Pop!_OS 20.04 Nvidia (64-bit)][2]
  
Donâ€™t forget to seed! I will be.
