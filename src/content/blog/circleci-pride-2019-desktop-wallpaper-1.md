In continuing with my series of CircleCI desktop wallpapers, I've made a couple to celebrate Pride Month 2019.
This is the first wallpaper and you can find the second one [here][part-2].

You'll find the preview in this post but you can download the full resolution 4K/16:9 version (for normal screens) and a nearly-4K/16:10 version (for Macbook-like screens) from the links below.
