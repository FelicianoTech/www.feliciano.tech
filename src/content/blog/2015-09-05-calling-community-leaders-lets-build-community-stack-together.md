> The purpose of Community Stack is to provide a single integrated software solution to facilitate online communities.

We’re looking to create a single software suite to help open-source projects as well as non-technical communities collaborate online, share with each other, communicate, and develop lasting relationships. Basically, we&#8217;d like to shorten the <a href="http://opensource.com/life/15/7/10-community-tools" target="_blank">list of software/websites needed to run a community</a>.

As we set out on this mission, we’re going to **need help**. As with any open-source project, we&#8217;re going to need developers, we&#8217;re going to need designers, we&#8217;re going to need idea people. To start however, **we need community leaders**!

No matter which community you represent, we want your input. You don&#8217;t need to be a developer, just have a good handle on how your community operates and what its needs are. As part of a &#8220;community council&#8221;,  or &#8220;community board&#8221;, your input will ensure this project heads in the right direction.

We need people who are passionate leaders in active (or promising) communities to provide guidance, suggestions, and help us form a tool that your communities would use. We need you!

## Discussion & Connect

Currently, I&#8217;ve set up a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/100390227809712927544" target="_blank">Google+ community</a> to provide a place for discussion. If you don&#8217;t like Google[+], please feel free to leave a comment and suggest something else, or simply have a discussion in the comments! If you know of anymore who might be interested please share.

The actual technology that I want to use to build this is still up in the air. I envision this being built on top of [headless] Drupal with custom modules, wrapper code, etc. The code and specific technologies aren&#8217;t important at this time however. The overall idea and feature set is what I would like to focus on now. Some communities that I&#8217;m currently a fan of include:

  * <a href="http://developer.getpebble.com/" target="_blank">Pebble Developer Website</a>
  * <a href="https://duck.co/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo&#8217;s Community</a> (<a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform" target="_blank">code</a>)

**So what does your community need?**
