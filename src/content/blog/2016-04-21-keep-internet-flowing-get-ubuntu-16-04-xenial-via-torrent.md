Congratulations to everyone who worked on and shipped Ubuntu 16.04 &#8220;Xenial Xerus&#8221;. Every time a Long-Term Support (LTS) release goes out I&#8217;m very excited. Knowing it will be out and supported for 5 years is just great.

Anyway, I just want to remind everyone that you can download the Ubuntu 16.04 ISOs via torrent. This allows you to reduce the strain on Canonical’s (and their mirror) servers while possibly being a faster download as well.

Here are the torrents for both the desktop and server release:

[Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS Desktop (64-bit)][1]  
[Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS Server (64-bit)][3]  

You can also get the torrents straight from the [Ubuntu downloads][9] page for the paranoid types 🙂

Don’t forget to seed!
