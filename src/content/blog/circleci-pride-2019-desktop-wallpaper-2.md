In continuing with my series of CircleCI desktop wallpapers, I've made a couple to celebrate Pride Month 2019.
This is the second wallpaper and you can find the first one [here][part-1].

This particular wallpaper has both a light and dark variant.
Take a look below to choose your favorite.
You'll find the preview in this post but you can download the full resolution 4K/16:9 version (for normal screens) and a nearly-4K/16:10 version (for Macbook-like screens) from the links below.
