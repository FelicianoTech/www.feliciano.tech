February 1st is my anniversary date at CircleCI.
Instead of celebrating my 8th year at the company, I was laid off by CircleCI the day before, January 31st.
I was a bit shaken. I wasn't sure how I felt.
Was I sad? scared? relieved?
I went in and out of all these emotions for the first few weeks.
In mid-February, though, an emotion grew in the pit of my stomach that hasn't subsided.
I'm pissed.

I want to be clear: I'm not angry at CircleCI.
I was laid off.
It's happening all over our industry.
I learned a lot during my time there.
I was angry at myself.
I didn't have much savings, I didn't have a ready resume and professional network, and I wasn't taking any of my projects seriously.
I knew better, yet I fell into the same trap many fall into.
I got comfortable and complacentâ€”a mistake.

I grew up poor and always felt like I had my back against the wall.
Like my favorite New York Mets baseball team, I've always considered myself an underdog.
I grew to accept the hand life gave me and use it to motivate me.
It was myself against the world.
I'm angry that I lost my way.
It's okay now because I am doing something about it.
I feel that "fire" in me again for the first time in many years.

My time [employed with Linode](/blog/leaving-linode-best-job-ive-yet/), the U.S. Navy, and now CircleCI have all ended.
