In continuing with my series of CircleCI desktop wallpapers, here's another one.
I meant to make a Halloween wallpaper last year but ran out of time.
This year I made it with 3 days to spare.

You'll find the preview in this post but you can download the full resolution 4K/16:9 version (for normal screens) and a nearly-4K/16:10 version (for Macbook-like screens) from the links below.
