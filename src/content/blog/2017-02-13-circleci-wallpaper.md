February 1st was my one year anniversary with [CircleCI][cci-site]. Looking back on the past year, I had a blast and I'm excited for what's coming up in the future for both CircleCI and myself. In celebration, this weekend I made a CircleCI wallpaper for my laptop that I'd like to share. You'll find the preview below as well as links to the 16:9 version (for normal laptops) and a 16:10 version (I'm looking at you Apple).<!--more-->
