If you run Google Chrome on a system using Apt (e.i. Ubuntu & Debian) you may have noticed that on March 2nd, running `apt-get update` fails. Specifically, you would have gotten this error:

> Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/dists/stable/Release Unable to find expected entry &#8216;main/binary-i386/Packages&#8217; in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)

followed by:

> Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

This is actually on purpose, Google <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/01/google-chrome-linux-32-bit-discontinued" target="_blank">told us several months ago</a> that they would be dropping support for 32-bit Linux. If you&#8217;re running a 32-bit distro you are SOL. Many people including myself however are not running a 32-bit system. I&#8217;m running Ubuntu 15.10 (64-bit) on my <a href="https://feliciano.tech/blog/dell-xps-13-developer-edition-more-than-a-laptop-running-linux/" target="_blank">shiny Dell XPS 13</a>. Turns out, if you have i386 as a supported architecture in Apt, you&#8217;ll still run into this problem. In my case, I have Android Studio installed which is 32-bit. This caused Apt to look for an i386 package in the Chrome repository even though I didn&#8217;t need it, causing this issue.

## The Fix

Some blog sites have covered the issue but didn&#8217;t fully fix the problem for everyone. The source list for Google Chrome can be in a few files and it even gets regenerated by Chrome. The best approach I have so far is to run the following:

    sudo sed -i -e 's/deb http/deb [arch=amd64] http/' "/opt/google/chrome/cron/google-chrome"
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google*
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list'
    

I&#8217;ve taken this approach because some distros or versions of Google Chrome moved the file around. I&#8217;ve seen the file at `google.list`, `google-chrome.list`, `google-chrome.list.save`, etc.
