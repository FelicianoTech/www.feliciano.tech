- Docker Hugo: Bumped Ruby version used to v2.4.x. - <https://github.com/felicianotech/docker-hugo/pull/25>
- Docker Hugo: Fixed issue where the old Docker Hub repo wasn't getting all new tags. - <https://github.com/felicianotech/docker-hugo/pull/24>
- Created the "Hugo Scaffold" project as a way for me to create new Hugo-based sites faster. - <https://github.com/felicianotech/hugo-scaffold>

Otherwise it was a fairly slow month for my contributions.
