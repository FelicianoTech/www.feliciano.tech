The newly created U.S. Space Force has been popping up in the news regularly.
Most recently the U.S. Air Force [revealed the seal of the U.S. Space Force](https://twitter.com/usairforce/status/1220876093596545024).
Whether you think the Space Force is a good idea or not, it's now a reality and I'm pretty sure not everyone knows where it fits in the military.
Especially since to this day most people still don't understand how the Marines fit into the structure either.

So, I've created a quick diagram of the U.S. Military structure and how each organization relates to each other.
Hopefully someone finds it useful.
