TL;DR &#8211; Nexus devices are designed by Google and manufactured with a partner. Pixel devices are designed and manufactured by Google, without a (public) partner.<!--more-->

I was listening to an episode of [Material][1], a Google & Android podcast during my long drive from New Jersey to California. In the episode, they discussed Google&#8217;s introduction to the Pixel C. It looks like the hosts were actually confused on what the difference between Nexus and Pixel is. Talking with some people, it seems many people are confused.

## [Nexus][2]

The Nexus brand name represents Google&#8217;s program to showcase Android features, usually simultaneously launching with a new release of Android. These devices are usually designed by Google and manufactured with a hardware partner. Unlike traditional Android devices, Google controls the software UI, hardware design, software update process, pre-installed apps, and they share the distribution with the hardware partner. With the exception of the Galaxy Nexus, Google does not allow the partner to brand the device. Nexus represents a device that supports all core operating system features while maintaining a balance between device costs, hardware power, and build-quality.

## [Pixel][3]

The Pixel brand name represents the best of the best, actually manufactured by Google (or, at least, white-labeled). In Google&#8217;s own words:The precision engineered Pixel family from Google

The Pixel brand is not synonymous with ChromeOS. As seen by the release of the Pixel C, Pixel devices can be Android. Maybe something else in the future. Unlike a manufacturer such as Samsung, Dell, etc, Google doesn&#8217;t seem to be out for market-share with the Pixel brand. Pixel devices are built to represent what a perfect device would be, with cutting-edge technology, regardless of price. This can be seen with the Chromebook Pixel, the most technically advanced Chromebook at the time, or the Chromebook Pixel 2, one of the first laptops with USB type-C.

## Summary

Google has several brands and isn&#8217;t always clear on what the differences are. Chrome, based on their browser, is growing with the browser, ChromeOS, and ChromeCast. Android Silver was a seemingly failed brand for high-end Android devices. The line between Nexus and Pixel isn&#8217;t obviously clear either. As mentioned in the TL;DR section, the concrete difference is who manufactured the device.
