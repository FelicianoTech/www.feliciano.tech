As a professional in the tech industry, I rely on Google Search everyday to find answers.

Many times when I&#8217;m searching for something, it is usually technical, and something that the answer might change over time. Quick example, let&#8217;s say I wanted to know more about [Ubuntu][1] and Python 3 because I&#8217;m curious if they&#8217;re ever going to change the default version. The very first result on Google is [this wiki page][2]. That&#8217;s not helpful because it&#8217;s a debate on whether Ubuntu will ever have Python 3 by default, with no decision. When I use Google Search Tools and narrow my search to the last 30-days, the first result I get now is the [Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) release notes][3] which clearly shows me that Python 3 is now the default install on Ubuntu. Exactly the information I was looking for.

To make your search results more relevant, I suggest taking advantage of Google Search Tools. After you start your search and you&#8217;re on the results page, there is a menu under the search bar. The last item says &#8220;Search tools&#8221;. Clicking that slides out a menu where you can adjust the time-frame of the search. Here&#8217;s a picture of it:

## How I use it

  * For many searches, I&#8217;ll set the range to the past year
  * Specifically for reviews of new products or news, I&#8217;ll set it to the last 30-days

## There is one drawback though

Google Search Tools smallest time range is only &#8220;Past hour&#8221;. So if you&#8217;re trying to do research on what the hottest JavaScript framework is, your results are already out of date. ðŸ™‚

**Update**: I was put onto a blog post that really unearths the full potential of Google Search. [Check it out][5].
