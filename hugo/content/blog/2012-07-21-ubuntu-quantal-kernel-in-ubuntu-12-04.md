As Quantal Quetzal slowly makes it&#8217;s journey to becoming Ubuntu 12.10, along with it comes a newer build of the great Linux Kernel. The Ubuntu Kernel team would like to bring that newer kernel to folks using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in time for the 12.04.1 maintenance release. Why do this? The newer kernel brings along support for newer hardware. SomeÂ notablesÂ include enhanced support for Intel&#8217;s Ivy-bridge line and Intel Graphics 4000. Supporting newer hardware is important for a long-term-support release like 12.04. Especially with the extended 5-year support for the desktop version. To that cause, they announced a &#8220;<a title="See The Blog Post" href="http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2012/07/call-for-testing-1210-kernel-on-1204.html" target="_blank">Call for Testing: 12.10 kernel on 12.04</a>&#8220;.

If you&#8217;re running Ubuntu 12.04, please consider giving it a try. I&#8217;m using a new Sony VAIO Z (mid-2012) and I can say many features just weren&#8217;t working for me on the Precise kernel. Participating in this not only helps a cause, but I got my brightness settings to work,Â multipleÂ resolution settings are now available, and honestly it&#8217;s fun ðŸ™‚
