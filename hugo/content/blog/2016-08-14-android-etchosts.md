Whenever I&#8217;m developing a website I frequently like to test my work on an actual mobile device. As great as [Chrome Developer Tools][1] is, nothing beats the feel of a real device.

Adding a domain name to my Nexus 6P&#8217;s `/etc/hosts` file didn&#8217;t seem to do anything. Android was not resolving my domain and I was getting nowhere. It took me awhile to figure out this little tip:

In order to get `/etc/hosts` to work on Android, the file needs to have a trailing newline character (Unix style not Windows style). Meaning the file needs to end in `\n`.

This took me a second to figure out but once I did that, the hosts file was working, even without restarting the phone as some sites suggest.
