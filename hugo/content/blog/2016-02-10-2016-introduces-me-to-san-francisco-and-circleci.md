The last week of January was very interesting for me. After <a href="https://feliciano.tech/blog/leaving-linode-best-job-ive-yet/" target="_blank">resigning from my position</a> at Linode, I packed up everything I had and drove from Atlantic City all the way west to San Francisco. 2016Â introduces me to a new job and a new city and I&#8217;m so ready for it.<!--more-->

I left New Jersey during one of the biggest blizzards the North East has had in a while. Driving into PhiladelphiaÂ acrossÂ the Walt Whitman Bridge was intense. The wind was blowing hard and snow was everywhere. The tolls had a bunch of packed snow, causing me to almost slide into one of the barriers.

I droveÂ through five different states before I escaped the snow. It was all worth it however as I am extremely excited to now be living in San Francisco, the city almost as awesome as New York ðŸ˜‰ Why am I excited? My first full weekend here I got to relax atÂ Ocean Beach and take in the beauty of what is Lands End (the picture I took at the top of this post). There are so many Starbucks here that even the trains are plastered with branding.

I&#8217;m also very excited to be taking on the role of a Developer Evangelist at <a href="https://circleci.com" target="_blank">CircleCI</a>. WeÂ provide a developer tool offering fast and flexibleÂ Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for software projects. I&#8217;ve been here now for a week and a half and I&#8217;m very happy with my decision. The only thing that might be more impressive than the software are the people behind it. The peopleÂ at CircleCI are very smart and I&#8217;m looking forward to learning everything I can from them.

For anyone living in San Francisco reading this or flying in for <a href="http://www.developerweek.com/" target="_blank">Developer Week</a>, I&#8217;ll see you there! We also have aÂ <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CircleCI-Office-Hours/events/228090957/" target="_blank">CircleCI Office Hours</a>Â on February 17th where you can meet the team, discuss CircleCI things, and most importantly, eat free pizza! I&#8217;m looking forward to the dozensÂ of local meetups and comparing notes with the best and brightest.<figure id="attachment_1264" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
