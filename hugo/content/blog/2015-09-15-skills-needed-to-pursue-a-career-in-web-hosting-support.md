Working in web hosting technical support, you need a varied set of skills. Firstly, you need to decide which area of the market you want to work in. There are hosting companies that offer strictly Windows-based products while there are others that offer Linux-based products.

I come from the Linux side of the house (which I believe to be larger) so I will go into more detail regarding Linux. When I first started at <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a> (a Linux-based hosting company) I started out in the Customer Support department. At Linode, we don&#8217;t offer just a single Linux distribution (for example Bluehost just uses CentOS). We offer several Linux distros which means as technicians, we need to be familiar with distros across the board.<!--more-->

## Skills/Technology

Linux specifically is important. Understanding what the kernel is, how it works, and the boot process of a Linux server is helpful. A large portion of issues will be when the server simply doesn&#8217;t start right, or maybe doesn&#8217;t start at all.

How IPv4 & IPv6 networking works, how the ext2/3/4 filesystems work, SWAP, and understanding processes are all very important. Knowing what ports popular services use and how iptables works is important to.

Understanding the difference between Debian family distros and Red Hat family distros lends itself to understanding how to administer those very distros. Package managers are different (apt-get, rpm, yum, dnf). The tool used to start, stop, and checkout services (init systems) will vary as well across distros (such as SysV, Upstart, and SystemD).

To learn some of these things, the <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/" target="_blank">Linux Academy</a> is a pretty good site. To test your knowledge, in a timed, realistic (intense) environment, <a href="https://trueability.com/" target="_blank">TrueAbility</a> is awesome.

It&#8217;s useful to read a book and learn these things well. It&#8217;s **better** to throw away that book and install and use these things yourself. Troubleshooting something yourself to fix it earns you a better understanding of that thing. Troubleshooting is &#8220;the&#8221; skill.

## Certifications

There are several certifications that would help. To be efficient, if you could only take one I would highly recommend <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/linux.aspx" target="_blank">CompTIA&#8217;s Linux+</a> certification. Not only does it cover a lot (and was updated this year), many companies will definitely be impressed with you arriving at the interview with that certification already in your back pocket. The beauty of Linux+ is that CompTIA also gives you the option to send your test result to the Linux Professional Institute and SUSE. This gives you Linux+, <a href="https://www.lpi.org/certification/get-certified-lpi/lpic-1-linux-server-professional/" target="_blank">LPIC-1 certification</a>, and SUSE Certified Linux Administrator (CLA). <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/linux.aspx#3for1" target="_blank">That&#8217;s three certifications at once</a>.

With that being said, if you really want to expand your knowledge and earn the right to be higher tier technical support or move to specialized departments, you&#8217;ll want even more certs (knowledge areas). Personally, I have A+, Security+, and Network+ which I feel have helped me greatly in my career. Feedback from colleagues also suggest getting Certified Ethical Hacker (security), CCNA (networking), or <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification" target="_blank">Red Hat&#8217;s line of certifications</a> for better knowledge into their family of systems.

## The Most Important Skills of All

Many people seem to either skip or gloss over soft skills. This is something that makes all the difference in Linode Support as well as companies such as <a href="http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news/jd-power-2015.htm" target="_blank">T-Mobile</a> and Starbucks.

When a customer contacts technical support, they have a problem. There is something that is blocking them from doing their work, running their business, finishing their school project, etc. This is something that may be causing them stress, freaking them out, or costing them money. In this scenario they don&#8217;t need a support technician that loathes customers and their problems. They don&#8217;t need someone dismissive or someone who thinks everything is so simple you must be dumb to not know it.

The best technical support (or any support) person is someone who can empathise with the customer. Someone who makes a connection with their customer and is willing to do everything in their power to assist them. Knowing all of the skills I mentioned above is only half the battle. As Einstein said, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t explain it simply, you don&#8217;t understand it well enough.&#8221;

There are other assorted skills you would need to know, though many are needed for any great career not necessarily technical support. These include things like organization, responsibility, attentiveness, and more. I hope this gives you some insight on what might be needed.

If you have these skills, I would love to be your teammate. <a href="https://www.linode.com/careers" target="_blank">Linode is hiring</a>.
