A couple of weeks ago I received a mysterious invite from Google via Twitter inviting me to a #NexusStudio event. I happily RSVPed and didn&#8217;t regret it one bit.<!--more-->

The event took place in Manhattan, almost two weeks ago, spanning 4 days. I went on Friday, December 11th. Arriving at  Nexus Open Studio I quickly learned I was in for a treat. They had security standing outside with two lines forming. The door to get in had a slick event logo painted on it. Waiting on the line with other Nexus fans (and curious techies) I quickly got to chatting about everything Android, Nexus, and my newly bought Huawei Watch running Android Wear. About 30 minutes before the doors open, servers greeted us outside carrying trays of steaming hot chocolate with marshmallows on top. How fitting _and delicious_.

When we finally got inside I was very impressed. There were many &#8216;sections&#8217; that you could visit to explore different aspects of what Nexus is. Both as a phone and more importantly, as an experience.

The _Lending Booth_ lets you borrow a Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P for the night in exchange for your driver&#8217;s license. You can even swap between them whenever you want. I played around with the Nexus 6P all night, taking pictures and trying to trip up the fingerprint reader called Nexus Imprint with little success. It simply works. In fact, it worked so well that last week I bought one from the Google Store, taking advantage of the $50 off sale.

On the largest wall, Google had exhibits on display for several [Android Experiments][1]. I had the opportunity to play with and examine several cool projects/Android apps. One pretty amazing one actually took a picture of you using a Nexus 5x and then sent instructions to two pulley systems to move a pencil and illustrate your face, right on paper. It was awesome to watch in person.

There was an open bar and several types of appetizers that made rounds. My absolute favorite part, however, was the user experience (UX) talks. I got to see Android&#8217;s VP of engineering and several other team members get on stage and discuss how they made the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and the design decisions that went into Android Marshmallow.

The day ended with more walking around and talking. Everyone that spoke on stage, in addition to other Google employees from the Android Marketing Department were all hanging around ready to chat and receive feedback. It was a unique opportunity to interact with the very people who made Marshmallow and the new Nexus phones. All for free, all in a very cool, relaxed setting.

On my way out, I was given a thank you present by the staff; Android wrapping paper with some stickers, a thank you card, and a cool Android pin. A picture of that and more can be seen in the gallery below.

I really enjoyed attending Nexus Open Studio. It was a very well put together event with a great vibe, semi-private feel, and unique opportunities to learn about Nexus and provide direct feedback. Thanks Google for inviting me. I hope I get to attend more in the future.
