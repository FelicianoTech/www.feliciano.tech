I came across a very nice blog post called, &#8220;<a href="http://nordicapis.com/day-in-the-life-of-an-api-developer-evangelist/" target="_blank">Day in the Life of an API Developer Evangelist</a>&#8220;. This is a great post for any new or future developer evangelist to read. I&#8217;d also say that this is a great post to share with your employer who may be interested in starting an evangelism program but perhaps aren&#8217;t to sure of the job description.<!--more-->

If for whatever reason you don&#8217;t read it, these are my two favorite parts of the post. This quote:

> The primary role of a developer evangelist in forming a developer community is to help customers and potential users see the value and benefit in your product or API to such an extent that they themselves become evangelists for your company. &#8211;Liz Rush, Developer Evangelist at Algorithmia

And this nice little table of what we typically do:<figure id="attachment_1354" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
