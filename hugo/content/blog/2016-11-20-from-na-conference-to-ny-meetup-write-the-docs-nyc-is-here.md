In May of this year, I attended the [Write the Docs conference][1] in Portland for the first time. It was an enjoyable experience and my most favorite conference to date. You can read about my experience [here][2]. I said at the end of that blog post that I was so inspired that I&#8217;d start a local meetup for Write the Docs in New York City. Half a year later, I have finally done so.<!--more-->

The [first meetup][5] is scheduled for December 2, 2016. The plan is a light discussion on how continuous integration and continuous deployment can benefit docs as well as discuss and shape the future of this meetup. If you are in the New York area and are interested in documentation &#8211; be it a technical writer, developer, project manager, or just doc curious, please come and join us.
