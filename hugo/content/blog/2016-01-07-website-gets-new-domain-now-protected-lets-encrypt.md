Happy New Year everyone!

To start off 2016 right, I made two changes to this website. First, I switched over to the domain Feliciano.Tech (from FelicianoTech.com). This short and sweet domain was bought several weeks ago after pressure from <a href="http://alexfornuto.com/" target="_blank">Alex Fornuto</a>. I really like it and it&#8217;s now the primary domain for this site.

Second, I dumped my StartSSL certificate that I purchased earlier this year from NameCheap in favor of a certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>. I believe ALL websites should be running HTTPS and I&#8217;ve <a href="https://feliciano.tech/blog/10-tips-on-running-https-websites-always-on-ssl/" target="_blank">written about it before</a>. Fortunately, many people and companies had the same belief and formed Let&#8217;s Encrypt, a free certificate authority (CA) for everyone to use. They <a href="https://twitter.com/letsencrypt/status/684221075966705664" target="_blank">recently announced</a> their 250,000th certificate issued, with this site now being in the mix.

    Just issued our 250,000th certificate!
